wordpress_auth

A small project that was made to create, login/logout, and delete WordPress users outside the context of a WordPress site. It would be used if you were integrating your WordPress site into another platform, for example if you wanted to use WP for your landing pages and blog, but use a different PHP framework for other functionality (like a webstore, report system, custom application functionality, etc).  It bootstraps the WP code and provides a nice interface to do WP user auth and management within a couple of classes.
